Part Three of Capital Volume 2 centers around something called “the total social capital.” This third Part is the most read section of the neglected Volume 2; in our introduction we read that it is its "most important part." Marx begins his characterization of this important term by differentiating it from the analyses of the capital in Volume 1 and parts One and Two of Volume 2. 

Volume 1 was all about the capitalist production process. We bracketed questions of circulation (what Marx calls the “formal and material changes undergone by capital”), and instead focused on the the specifically capitalist process of labour, which resulted in the valorization of capital and the production of surplus value. This is why we assumed that the “capitalist sells the product at its value.” Such a question lies outside of the process of labour per se, as it concerns the totality of social capital and not the isolated event or even reproductive process of capitalist production.
