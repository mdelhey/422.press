#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Thus /M/ --- /C/ --- /L/ / /mp/ does not simply express the qualitative relationship in which a certain sum of money, e.g. Â£422, is transformed into means of production and labour-power of a corresponding sum, but also a quantitative ratio between the portion of the money spent on labour-power /L/ and on the means of production /mp/, this ratio being conditioned from the start by the excess or surplus labour that the number of workers involved have to expend (Capital vol. 2, pp. 110-1).
