<h1 class="title">On the Origins of Inherent Contradiction in Hegel's <i>Lesser Logic</i></h1>
<p>
In his discussions of the Logical moment of the dialectic, Hegel <span class="underline">appears</span> to be asserting something
along the lines of 'everything is inherently contradictory'. Indeed, in the <span class="underline">Addition</span> to §48,
Hegel, asserts that the "true and positive significance" of Kant's antinomies<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> is that "everything actual contains opposed determinations
within it" such that "comprehension of an ob-ject amounts precisely to our becoming conscious of it
as a concrete unity of opposed determinations" (93)<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>. Or, in the <span class="underline">Remark</span>, that "antinomy is
found not only in the [Kant's] four particular ob-jects taken from cosmology, but rather in <span class="underline">all</span>
objects of all kinds, in <span class="underline">all</span> representations, concepts, and ideas" (92). But what is less clear is
from where these inherent contradictions arise.
</p>

<p>
What proceeds is an exegetical account of&#x2014;and a coming to grips with&#x2014;the <b><b>origins</b></b> of Hegelian
contradiction that is inherent or inward. In doing so, I hope to shed light on <b><b>what</b></b> inherent
contradiction amounts to within the <span class="underline">Lesser Logic</span>, <b><b>why</b></b> Hegel thinks it to be found in
everything real, and finally its <b><b>importance</b></b> to Hegel as the constitutive property of the
dialectical moment of logical thinking.
</p>

<p>
Something should be said about the similarity between my current project and Thomas Bole's essay
<i>Contradiction in Hegel's Science of Logic</i> <sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.
Without a doubt, Bole is the primary source of inspiration for what is written here. However, I seek
further clarification of the origins of contradiction within the <span class="underline">Lesser Logic</span>. Bole finds Hegel's
assertion that 'everything is inherently contradictory' to be inconsistent with the Logic, whereas I
try to fit it into a reading of the <span class="underline">Lesser Logic</span>. Moreover, Bole circumscribes contradiction
within the content of the Logic, whereas I begin with considering contradiction within the form of
the logic and its division. The result is that, for Bole, contradiction (or its category) figures
into the logic as a secondary player as "that structure of negativity in which each of the relate is
what it is by denying its own identity as something contradistinguished from its other and
identifying itself with that other" (525). Bole's conception of contradiction is primarily
ascertained from the "unpacking of the structure of reflection", and as a result finds its use
merely as a theoretical requirement for reflection as opposed to an impetus for dialectic as well as
part of its result, as I find it to be.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orga254502" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga254502">Origins of Contradiction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga254502">
<p>
In at least one place in the Logic, Hegel characterizes contradiction as the fundamental property of
the dialectical moment. We might, then, be tempted to conclude that the origins of contradiction lie
in the dialectical moment as well. However, Hegel, in his discussion of Kant in §48, attributes the
discovery of the antinomies to the logical position of the understanding, placing them prior to the
genuine dialectical moment. Kant's great achievement is the realization, from the perspective of the
understanding, that the categories themselves bring about the contradiction: "this thought, that the
contradiction which is posited by the determinations of the understanding in what is rational is
<span class="underline">essential</span> and <span class="underline">necessary</span>, has to be considered one of the most important and profound advances of
the philosophy of modern times" (92). Insofar as Kant thinks from the perspective of the
understanding, and insofar as his antinomies bring us into contact with true contradiction, then,
without ever leaving the first moment of the logical idea, we are confronted with inherent
contradiction.
</p>

<p>
This contradiction has divergent implications for reason in Kant and Hegel. The Kantian move is to
find that this contradiction lies not in the object itself but rather is the fault of reason and its
cognition of the object, keeping intact the consistency of the world at the cost of the consistency
of reason. Hegel instead brings the object into the realm of immanence, and so brings the object's
inherent contradiction (opposed determinations) into rationality as well. Within the speculative
logic, objects are comprehended in their truth in virtue of the appreciation of the concrete unity
of their opposed determinations, i.e. in virtue of the appreciation their inherent contradiction.
Contradiction, once again, lies within (is inherent to) the object or, speculatively comprehended,
within thinking, and is discovered within the moment of understanding. If contradiction had its
origins somewhere outside of the moment of the understanding or was not prior to the dialectical
moment, then in what sense could a thinking rooted in the understanding be said to discover it?
</p>

<p>
But perhaps this priority ascribed to contradiction over the dialectical is itself a one-sided
abstraction of the Logical truth. Recall that the three divisions of the Logic are "moments of
everything logically real, i.e., of every concept or of everything true in general" that, however,
can only be held apart within the moment of the understanding, and in doing so, lose their truth
(125). If the truth of the logically real depends upon keeping together the logical moments as
moments of the Concept, then talk of such temporality is seemingly misguided. On the other hand,
Hegel is no stranger to talk of <span class="underline">movement</span> between concepts and their determinations. Determinations
are first immediate, <span class="underline">then</span> mediated, etc. The resolution is to understand temporal talk in Hegel's
categorial development as analogously immanent and categorial, i.e. as an ordering of the categories
in thinking. So when I say that contradiction is prior to dialectic, I mean that contradiction is
prior to dialectic in the development of the categories in thinking. Yet, so long as contradiction
is prior and not appreciated within the concrete unity of the Concept, then it is not known in its
truth. Therefore, what is left to be said about contradiction within this current delimitation is
its place within the logic as a singular, untrue moment of the logic.
</p>

<p>
So, towards answering our question on the origins of Hegelian inherent contradiction, we can say
that inherent contradiction is prior in order to the dialectical moment, that it must fall somewhere
between the logical moments of understanding and dialectic. Hegel gives an abstract account of these
two logical moments in his overview of the division of logic, shining light on their interrelation
(§80 and §81, respectively):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Thinking as understanding stops short at the fixed determinacy and its distinctness vis-a-vis
other determinacies; such a restricted abstraction counts for the understanding as one that
subsists on its own account, and simply is (123).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From the perspective of understanding, objects and their determinations are distinguished from each
other without a proper appreciation for what they truly amount to. Objects are separated and
abstracted, <span class="underline">opposed</span>. However, the understanding makes the reverse conclusion: it sees its limited
account of the object as independent, where it really is an account grounded entirely in dependency
towards other objects.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The dialectical moment is the self-sublation of these finite determinations [of the understanding]
on their own part, and their passing into their opposites (128).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the dialectic, objects and their isolated, finite determinations are self-sublated, the result of
which is the negation of their determinations. Within this moment, the determinations of the object
and their negation find themselves in some sort of coexistence or passing, however in this
coexistence they are not independent as they were in the understanding. Hegel calls the dialectic
immanent transcending for this reason: entirely within the object, the isolated determinations found
from the moment of the understanding are transcended, by means of their own sublation, into
something new, their negation. The negated determination is no longer isolated as it was in the
understanding, it is posited in relationship.
</p>

<p>
The dialectic, then, is in some sense a <span class="underline">resolution</span> of the inherent contradictions in objects found
by the understanding. The need to resolve these inherent contradictions is the very impetus for the
dialectic: "the finite sublates itself because it contradicts itself inwardly" (129), the result of
which is not more contradiction, but rather is something-concrete, the negation of the original
determinations. When Hegel says that everything finite is its own sublation, it is because
everything finite is inherently contradictory. Perhaps this is why Hegel characterizes dialectic as
immanent coherence: it comprehends the incoherence of inherent contradiction through their
self-sublation. Contradiction has its origins in the moment of the understanding (the abstract
either-or) but finds its statement and resolution within dialectic (the principle of movement).

<div id="outline-container-org20ffc6c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org20ffc6c">The Movement from Pure Being to Being-there</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org20ffc6c">
<p>
It may help to consider an example. Let us consider the further categorization of, or movement from,
the category of being to the category of being-there at the final moment in which becoming inwardly
collapses, resulting in being-there. At this point in the Logic, being has been found in its
ultimate immediacy to be pure being. Pure being, in its turn, has been found to be pure abstraction
which, taken immediately, is nothing. We have posited that (empty and abstract) being is the same as
or identical to (empty and abstract) nothing. That is to say, being and nothing have passed into
their opposites; we have undertaken a dialectical turn. From the position of the understanding,
being and nothing are held separate and fixed. As we inspect being, we find it to be nothing which
we understand to be contradictory. The dialectical move is to overcome the opposed determinations
via positing becoming as their <span class="underline">simple</span> unity (without relation) as the determinate result.
Becoming, as the result or affirmation contained within the contradiction, is itself inherently
contradictory and unstable, as it does not relate being and nothing within itself and has not gone
beyond the negative. Therefore, it must give way to the speculative move, to being-there (§89):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In becoming, being, as one with nothing, and nothing as one with being, are only vanishing (terms);
because of its contradiction becoming collapses inwardly into the unity within which both are
sublated; in this way its result is <span class="underline">being-there</span> (145).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Becoming contains an inherent contradiction, the simple unity of being and nothing. Being there is
the true, speculative resolution of the half-abstracted, half-concrete result of the becoming, the
previous dialectical result. Hegel states in the following <span class="underline">Remark</span>, "being-there is the unity of
being and nothing, in which the immediacy of these determinations, and therewith their contradiction
[in the dialectical result of becoming], has disappeared in their relation" (146). There is no
mistaking that becoming, the result of the previous dialectic, is inherently contradictory.
</p>

<p>
It seems from this example that, in at least some sense, the result of dialectical moment includes
more contradiction. This new "more contradiction" is the introduction of a new contradiction rather
than a continuation of the old one, which was the impetus for the dialectical movement in the first
place. In the case of becoming, the first contradiction was the identity of being and nothing. The
second contradiction was their simple unity. The dialectical result is still something-concrete, but
also at the same time something-abstract. It follows that the dialectical moment itself is
responsible for inducing new inherent contradictions into logical reasoning.
</p>

<p>
How can this characterization of inherent contradiction as a product of dialectic be reconciled with
the supposed priority of inherent contradiction to dialectic? I'm not entirely sure. One solution
may be to understand this new contradiction as prior to the <span class="underline">next</span> dialectic movement and subsequent
to the last. In this way, some inherent contradiction is always there for dialectical reasoning to
overthrow into its opposite and move towards resolution. Within the Concept, this would inscribe
inherent contradiction within all its moments. But how would this explain the universality of
inherent contradiction <span class="underline">from the perspective of the understanding</span>? The point, it seems, is that,
from the perspective of understanding, one cannot see the inherent contradiction in all objects and
concepts. It is only within the Concept and through the dialectical movement in which inherent
contradiction shows itself in everything real.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8ed4376" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8ed4376">Appreciating Inherent Contradiction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8ed4376">
<p>
Taking dialectical to be both the resolution and the origin of inherent contradiction, we can try to
answer why Hegel thinks inherent contradiction is found in everything actual. Inherent contradiction
is no more than the opposed determinations found within every object or concept. It differs from
contradiction as such in that it is inward and immanent, never in regards to an external other.
Wherever one finds dialectic, one will also find the annihilation and preservation of contradiction.
Insofar as what is actual is rational, reality is structured by the categorial logic, and so must
undergo the dialectical moment, and so also inherent contradiction.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the Hegelian claim that 'everything is inherently contradictory' is no more offensive or
incorrect than the claim that 'the three parts of the logic are moments of everything real'.
Inherent contradiction is both the motivation for and the result of the dialectical moment. To
assert the inherent contradiction within an object is to emphasize the object's passing through the
dialectical moment as part of the unfolding of the categorial development.
</p>

<p>
Inherent contradiction, then, serves many purposes within the Logic. In the context of history of
philosophy, it was the inherent contradiction of the antinomies that turned thinking towards itself,
and so towards immanence. Before Kant, Cosmology dealt with the world and constructed absolute
antitheses (e.g. freedom and necessity). The inherent contradictions found within these antitheses,
and so of the world, resulted in the innovation that Cosmology dealt not with the world-in-itself,
but rather the world as it appears and that the inherent contradictions, the antitheses, were in the
faulty cognition of this appearance as opposed to the world-in-itself. Hegel sees his realization
that 'everything is inherently contradictory' as the fundamental innovation of his philosophical
thinking<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>, and in
this way inherent contradiction can be said to be important for Hegel.
</p>

<p>
However, inherent contradiction is also important for Hegel as the impetus and source of movement
throughout the dialectical moment. The categorial justification for movements between the categories
is that to do so is to advance on the categorial hierarchy, from a category that is more abstract
and less determinate to a category that is less abstract and more determinate. The positing and
resolving of inherent contradiction allows for this deepening of determination, as the resolution of
contradiction involves the inscribing of two determinations into one. Moreover, the contradictory
nature of the categories secures the necessity of their movements. The fact that inherent
contradiction lay behind ensures that the categories develop in the right way, through the
resolution of the contradiction at hand, i.e. through the self-sublation of the finite and opposed
determinations.
</p>

<p>
On a final note, if one denies that Hegelian logic is committed to inherent contradiction, as Bole
does, there would seem to be potential problems in how Hegel places himself in the philosophical
tradition and his characterization of his Logic. On the other hand, a 'inherently contradictory'
reading of the Logic is at least possible, and allows Hegel to remain consistent within his own
text. If inherent contradiction is no worse than what is found here, then we should be careful to
dismiss it on grounds of its absurdity, less the critique fall on the entire Logic itself.

means no more than a contradiction in which both positions are equally justified: "the assertion of
two \textit{opposed} propositions about \textit{the same} ob-ject&#x2026; each of the propositions must
be affirmed with equal necessity" (91).</div></div>

[that antinomy is founds not only in the four particular ob-jects taken from Cosmology, but rather
in <i>all</i> objects of all kinds, in <i>all</i> representations, concepts, and ideas], and to be cognizant
of this property of ob-jects, belongs to what is essential in philosophical study" (90).</div></div>
